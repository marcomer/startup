| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none   | Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.                                    |
| block  | Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A `p` or `div` element has block display by default.        |
| inline | Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A `b` or `span` element has inline display by default. |
| flex   | Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.                                                                   |
| grid   | Display this element's children in a grid orientation.                                                                       |

**Viewport Meta Tag**
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
```

**Media Query**
```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  aside {
    display: none;
  }
}

@media (max-height: 700px) {
  header {
    display: none;
  }
  footer {
    display: none;
  }
}
```


## Grid
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```


## Flex
To get the division of space for the flexbox children correct we add the following flex properties to each of the children.

- **header** - `flex: 0 80px` - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
- **footer** - `flex: 0 30px` - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
- **main** - `flex: 1` - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be `flex` and specify the `flex-direction` to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.

```css
header {
  flex: 0 80px;
  background: hsl(223, 57%, 38%);
}

footer {
  flex: 0 30px;
  background: hsl(180, 10%, 10%);
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

Now we just need to add CSS to the control and content areas represented by the two child section elements. We want the controls to have 25% of the space and the content to have the remaining. So we set the `flex` property value to 1 and 3 respectively. That means that the controls get one unit of space and the content gets three units of space. No matter how we resize things this ratio will responsively remain.

```css
section:nth-child(1) {
  flex: 1;
  background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
}
section:nth-child(2) {
  flex: 3;
  background-color: white;
}
```

## Bootstrap
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

If you are going to use Bootstrap components that require JavaScript (carousel, buttons, and more), you will also need to include Bootstrap's JavaScript module. You add this by putting the following at **the end** of your HTML body element.

```html
<body>
  ...

  <script
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
</body>
```

You can use the Node Package Manager (NPM) to download Bootstrap and include it in your source code. That way you don't have to rely on someone else's server to provide you with a vital piece of your application. For future reference, to include Bootstrap in your application using NPM you would run the following from your console.

```sh
npm install bootstrap@5.2.3
```


## Position Property
+ `static` - default, not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties
+ `relative` - relative to its normal position. Adjust it away from normal position.
+ `fixed` - positioned relative to the viewport. Always stays in the same splace even if the page is scrolled.
+ `absolute` - positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
+ `sticky` - positioned based on the user's scroll position. Toggles between relative and fiexed.



# JavaScript

## Console
## Log

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.

```js
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```

You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.

```js
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.

```js
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```

## Timers

If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with `time` and `timeEnd` calls and it will output the duration between the `time` and `timeEnd` calls.

```js
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```

## Count

To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the `count` function.

```js
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```

## Linking to HTML
**index.js**

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

**index.html**

```html
<head>
  <script src="index.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

Notice that we call the `sayHello` and `sayGoodbye` JavaScript functions from the HTML in the `onclick` attribute of the button element. Special attributes like `onclick` automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value. The code specified by the attribute value can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code.

```html
<button onclick="let i=1;i++;console.log(i)">press me</button>
<!-- OUTPUT: 2 -->
```

| Type       | Use                                                                                    | Example                  |

## Loops
**for**

Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (`i++`) for adding one to a number.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

**do while**

```js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

**while**

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

**for in**

The `for in` statement iterates over an object's property names.

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```

For arrays the object's name is the array index.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```

**for of**

The `for of` statement iterates over an iterable's (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```


## Strings
```js
'quoted text'; // " also works

const l = 'literal';
console.log(`string ${l + (1 + 1)} text`);
// OUTPUT: string literal2 text
```

| Function      | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| length        | The number of characters in the string                       |
| indexOf()     | The starting index of a given substring                      |
| split()       | Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string |
| startsWith()  | True if the string has a given prefix                        |
| endsWith()    | True if the string has a given suffix                        |
| toLowerCase() | Converts all characters to lowercase                         |

```js
const s = 'Example:조선글';

console.log(s.length);
// OUTPUT: 11
console.log(s.indexOf('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: 8
console.log(s.split(':'));
// OUTPUT: ['Example', '조선글']
console.log(s.startsWith('Ex'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.endsWith('조선글'));
// OUTPUT: true
console.log(s.toLowerCase());
// OUTPUT: example:조선글
```


## Anonymous functions

Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.

```js
// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
```

## Creating, passing, and returning functions

Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.

```js
// Anonymous declaration of the function that is later assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Function that logs as a side effect of its execution
function labeler(label, value) {
  console.log(label + '=' + value);
}

// Function that takes a function as a parameter and then executes the function as a side effect
function addAndLabel(labeler, label, adder, a, b) {
  labeler(label, adder(a, b));
}

// Passing a function to a function
addAndLabel(labeler, 'a+b', add, 1, 3);
// OUTPUT: a+b=4

// Function that returns a function
function labelMaker(label) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(label + '=' + value);
  };
}

// Assign a function from the return value of the function
const nameLabeler = labelMaker('name');

// Calling the returned function
nameLabeler('value');
// OUTPUT: name=value
```

## Inner functions

Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.

```js
function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish
```

## Arrow Function

```js
() => 3;
```

The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```

Besides being compact, the `arrow` function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

## Return values

Arrow functions also have special rules for the `return` keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

```js
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```

## This pointer

Next, arrow functions inherit the `this` pointer from the scope of where it is created. This makes what is known as a `closure`. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript `scope`. For now consider the following example.

The function `makeClosure` returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the `a` parameter is overridden, a new `b` variable is created, and both `a` and `b` are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.

```js
function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
```

Next, we declare the variables `a` and `b` at the top level scope, and call `makeClosure` with `a`.

```js
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
```

Now, when we call `closure` function it will output the values contained in scope where it was created instead of the current values of the variables.

```js
console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
```


## Array Object Functions

The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop()`                 |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function to sort an array in place                  | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |
| reduce   | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)`   |
| map      | Run a function to map an array to a new array             | `a.map(i => i+i)`             |
| filter   | Run a function to remove items                            | `a.filter(i => i%2)`          |
| every    | Run a function to test if all items match                 | `a.every(i => i < 3)`         |
| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

## JSON
| Type    | Example                 |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| string  | "crockford"             |
| number  | 42                      |
| boolean | true                    |
| array   | [null,42,"crockford"]   |
| object  | {"a":1,"b":"crockford"} |
| null    | null                    |

Here is an example of a JSON document.

```json
{
  "class": {
    "title": "web programming",
    "description": "Amazing"
  },
  "enrollment": ["Marco", "Jana", "فَاطِمَة"],
  "start": "2025-02-01",
  "end": null
}
```

JSON is always encoded with [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). This allows for the representation of global data.

You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` functions.

```js
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);

console.log(obj, json, objFromJson);

// OUTPUT:
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined}
// {"a":2, "b":"crockford"}
// {a: 2, b: 'crockford'}
```

## Regular Expressions
You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```

The `string` class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's `test` function.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```

## Rest/Variadic Functions
JavaScript provides the `rest` syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the `rest` of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a `rest` parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

## Spread
Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

## Exceptions

```js
function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
```

## Destructuring
Destructuring, not to be confused with destructing, is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.

An example of destructuring arrays looks like the following.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
```

Note that even though it looks like you are declaring an array with the syntax on the left side of the expression, it is only specifying that you want to destructure those values out of the array.

You can also combine multiple items from the original object using rest syntax.

```js
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```

This works in a similar manner for objects, except with arrays, the assignment of the associated value was assumed by the positions in the two arrays. When destructuring objects, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a, c } = o;

console.log(a, c);
// OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
```

You can also map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```

Default values may also be provided for missing ones.

```js
const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
// OUTPUT: undefined, 22, 44
```

Note that all of the above examples created new constant variables, but you can also use destructuring to reassign existing variables.

```js
let a = 22;

[a] = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a);
// OUTPUT: 1
```

## Object Functions
| Function | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| entries  | Returns an array of key value pairs |
| keys     | Returns an array of keys            |
| values   | Returns an array of values          |

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```

## Constructor

Any function that returns an object is considered a `constructor` and can be invoked with the `new` operator.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```

Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

## Classes

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a `#`.

```js
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

## Inheritance

Classes can be extended by using the `extends` keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the `super` function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the `super` keyword.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```

## Get Const Static

```js
static get Name() {
  return 'name';
}
```


## Scope
1. **Global** - Visible to all code
1. **Module** - Visible to all code running in a module
1. **Function** - Visible within a function
1. **Block** - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces

## Var

Initially JavaScript used the keyword `var` to declare a variable. The problem with var, unlike `const` or `let`, is that it ignores block scope. Variables declared with `var` are always logically hoisted to the top of the function. For example, the following code shows the same variable name being used within different enclosing scopes. However, because var ignores block scope the for loop is simply assigning a new value to `x` rather than declaring a new variable that has the same name.

```js
var x = 10;
console.log('start', x);

for (var x = 0; x < 1; x++) {
  console.log('middle', x);
}

console.log('end', x);

// OUTPUT: start 10
//         middle 0
//         end 1
```

⚠ There are few cases where it makes sense to use `var`. It is strongly suggested that you only use `const` and `let` unless you fully understand why you are using `var`.

## This

The keyword `this` represents a variable that points to an object that contains the context within the scope of the currently executing line of code. The `this` variable is automatically declared and you can reference `this` anywhere in a JavaScript program. Because the value of `this` depends upon the context in which it is referenced, there are three different context that this can refer to:

1. **Global** - When `this` is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the `globalThis` object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
1. **Function** - When `this` is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running in JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
1. **Object** - When `this` is referenced in an object it refers to the object.

```js
'use strict';

// global scope
console.log('global:', this);
console.log('globalThis:', globalThis);

// function scope for a global function
function globalFunc() {
  console.log('globalFunctionThis:', this);
}
globalFunc();

// object scope
class ScopeTest {
  constructor() {
    console.log('objectThis:', this);
  }

  // function scope for an object function
  objectFunc() {
    console.log('objectFunctionThis:', this);
  }
}

new ScopeTest().objectFunc();
```

Running the above code in a browser results in the following.

```
global: Window
globalThis: Window
globalFunctionThis: undefined
objectThis: ScopeTest
objectFunctionThis: ScopeTest
```

Note that if we were not using JavaScript strict mode then globalFunctionThis would refer to Window.

## Closure

A closure is defined as a function and its surrounding state. That means whatever variables are accessible when a function is created are available inside that function. This holds true even if you pass the function outside of the scope of its original creation.

Here is an example of a function that is created as part of an object. That means that function has access to the object's `this` pointer.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: function () {
    console.log(this.x);
  },
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: object
```

Arrow functions are a bit different because they inherit the `this` pointer of their creation context. So if we change our previous example to return an arrow function, then the `this` pointer at the time of creation will be globalThis.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: () => console.log(this.x),
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: global
```

However, if we make function in our object that **returns** an arrow function, then the `this` pointer will be the object's `this` pointer since that was the active context at the time the arrow function was created.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  make: function () {
    return () => console.log(this.x);
  },
};

const f = obj.make();
f();
// OUTPUT: object
```

## Modules
JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.

JavaScript got full module support with ES6, and they have become the standard module representation as [browser support](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) for ES modules is now almost universal.

In order to differentiate between the two implementations, Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules. For this discussion, we will focus only on ES modules.

Because modules create a file-based scope for the code they represent, you must explicitly `export` the objects from one file and then `import` them into another file. For example, here is a simple module that exports a function that displays an alert.

**alert.js**

```js
export function alertDisplay(msg) {
  alert(msg);
}
```

You can import the module's exported function into another module using the `import` keyword.

**main.js**

```js
import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';

alertDisplay('called from main.js');
```

## ES Modules in the browser

When you use ES modules in the browser via HTML script references, things get a little complicated. The key thing to understand is that modules can only be called from other modules. You cannot access JavaScript contained in a module from the global scope that your non-module JavaScript is executing in.

From your HTML, you can specify that you are using an ES module by including a `type` attribute with the value of `module` in the `script` element. You can then import and use other modules. This is shown in the example below.

**index.html**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
  alertDisplay('module loaded');
</script>
```

If we want to use a module in the global scope that our HTML or other non-module JavaScript is executing in, then we must leak it into the global scope. We do this by either attaching an event handler or explicitly adding a function to the global window object. In the example below, we expose the `alertDisplay` imported module function by attaching it to the global JavaScript `window` object so that it can then be called from the button `onclick` handler. We also expose the module function by attaching a `keypress` event.

**index.html**

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
      window.btnClick = alertDisplay;

      document.body.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
        alertDisplay('Key pressed');
      });
    </script>
    <button onclick="btnClick('button clicked')">Press me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, if the button is pushed or a key is pressed our ES module function will be called.

## Modules with web frameworks

Fortunately, when you use a web framework bundler, discussed in later instruction, to generate your web application distribution code, you usually don't have to worry about differentiating between global scope and ES module scope. The bundler will inject all the necessary syntax to connect your HTML to your modules. Historically, this was done by removing the modules and placing all of the JavaScript in a namespaced global partition. Now that ES Modules are supported on most browsers, the bundler will expose the ES module directly.

Because of the complex history of modules they can be a confusing topic, but it is well worth the time to understand how they work as they are a core piece of a web programmer's toolkit.


## Document Object Model (DOM)
## Accessing the DOM

Every element in an HTML document implements the DOM Element interface, which is derived from the DOM Node interface. The [DOM Element Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) provides the means for iterating child elements, accessing the parent element, and manipulating the element's attributes. From your JavaScript code, you can start with the `document` variable and walk through the every element in the tree.

```js
function displayElement(el) {
  console.log(el.tagName);
  for (const child of el.children) {
    displayElement(child);
  }
}

displayElement(document);
```

You can provide a CSS selector to the `querySelectorAll` function in order to select elements from the document. The `textContent` property contains all of the element's text. You can even access a textual representation of an element's HTML content with the `innerHTML` property.

```js
const listElements = document.querySelectorAll('p');
for (const el of listElements) {
  console.log(el.textContent);
}
```

## Modifying the DOM

The DOM supports the ability to insert, modify, or delete the elements in the DOM. To create a new element you first create the element on the DOM document. You then insert the new element into the DOM tree by appending it to an existing element in the tree.

```js
function insertChild(parentSelector, text) {
  const newChild = document.createElement('div');
  newChild.textContent = text;

  const parentElement = document.querySelector(parentSelector);
  parentElement.appendChild(newChild);
}

insertChild('#courses', 'new course');
```

To delete elements call the `removeChild` function on the parent element.

```js
function deleteElement(elementSelector) {
  const el = document.querySelector(elementSelector);
  el.parentElement.removeChild(el);
}

deleteElement('#courses div');
```

## Injecting HTML

The DOM also allows you to inject entire blocks of HTML into an element. The following code finds the first `div` element in the DOM and replaces all the HTML it contains.

```js
const el = document.querySelector('div');
el.innerHTML = '<div class="injected"><b>Hello</b>!</div>';
```

However, directly injecting HTML as a block of text is a common attack vector for hackers. If an untrusted party can inject JavaScript anywhere in your application then that JavaScript can represent itself as the current user of the application. The attacker can then make requests for sensitive data, monitor activity, and steal credentials. The example below shows how the img element can be used to launch an attack as soon as the page is loaded.

```html
<img src="bogus.png" onerror="console.log('All your base are belong to us')" />
```

If you are injecting HTML, make sure that it cannot be manipulated by a user. Common injection paths include HTML input controls, URL parameters, and HTTP headers. Either sanitize any HTML that contains variables, or simply use DOM manipulation functions instead of using `innerHTML`.

## Event Listeners

All DOM elements support the ability to attach a function that gets called when an event occurs on the element. These functions are called [event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Here is an example of an event listener that gets called when an element gets clicked.

```js
const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.type);
});
```

There are lots of possible events that you can add a listener to. This includes things like mouse, keyboard, scrolling, animation, video, audio, WebSocket, and clipboard events. You can see the full list on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). Here are a few of the more commonly used events.

| Event Category | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Clipboard      | Cut, copied, pasted   |
| Focus          | An element gets focus |
| Keyboard       | Keys are pressed      |
| Mouse          | Click events          |
| Text selection | When text is selected |

You can also add event listeners directly in the HTML. For example, here is a `onclick` handler that is attached to a button.

```html
<button onclick='alert("clicked")'>click me</button>
```

## LocalStorage
The browser's `localStorage` API provides the ability to persistently store and retrieve data (i.e. scores, usernames, etc.,) on a user's browser across user sessions and HTML page renderings. For example, your frontend JavaScript code could store a user's name on one HTML page, and then retrieve the name later when a different HTML page is loaded. The user's name will also be available in local storage the next time the same browser is used to access the same website.

In addition to persisting application data between page renderings, `localStorage` is also used as a cache for when data cannot be obtained from the server. For example, your frontend JavaScript could store the last high scores obtained from the service, and then display those scores in the future if the service is not available.

## How to use LocalStorage

There are four main functions that can be used with localStorage.

| Function             | Meaning                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| setItem(name, value) | Sets a named item's value into local storage |
| getItem(name)        | Gets a named item's value from local storage |
| removeItem(name)     | Removes a named item from local storage      |
| clear()              | Clears all items in local storage            |

A local storage value must be of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. If you want to store a JavaScript object or array, then you must first convert it to a JSON string with `JSON.stringify()` on insertion, and parse it back to JavaScript with `JSON.parse()` when retrieved.

## Example

Open your startup website and run the following code in the browser's dev tools console window.

```js
let user = 'Alice';

let myObject = {
  name: 'Bob',
  info: {
    favoriteClass: 'CS 260',
    likesCS: true,
  },
};

let myArray = [1, 'One', true];

localStorage.setItem('user', user);
localStorage.setItem('object', JSON.stringify(myObject));
localStorage.setItem('array', JSON.stringify(myArray));

console.log(localStorage.getItem('user'));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('object')));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('array')));
```

**Output**

```sh
Alice
{name: 'Bob', info: {favoriteClass: 'CS 260', likesCS: true}
[1, 'One', true]
```

Notice that you are able to see the round trip journey of the local storage values in the console output. If you want to see what values are currently set for your application, then open the `Application` tab of the dev tools and select `Storage > Local Storage` and then your domain name. With the dev tools you can add, view, update, and delete any local storage values.


## Promises
JavaScript executes as a single threaded application. That means there is only ever one piece of code executing at the same time. However, the fact that it does not execute concurrently does not mean that it does not execute in parallel. You can asynchronously execute code with the use of a JavaScript `Promise`. Because the execution is asynchronous the promise object can be in one of three states at any given point in time.

1. **pending** - Currently running asynchronously
1. **fulfilled** - Completed successfully
1. **rejected** - Failed to complete

You create a promise by calling the Promise object constructor and passing it an executor function that runs the asynchronous operation. Executing asynchronously means that promise constructor may return before the promise executor function runs.

We can demonstrate asynchronous execution by using the standard JavaScript `setTimeout` function to create a delay in the execution of the code. The setTimeout function takes the number of milliseconds to wait and a function to call after that amount of time has expired. We call the delay function in a for loop in the promise executor and also a for loop outside the promise so that both code blocks are running in parallel.

```js
const delay = (msg, wait) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg, wait);
  }, 1000 * wait);
};

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Code executing in the promise
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    delay('In promise', i);
  }
});

// Code executing after the promise
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  delay('After promise', i);
}

// OUTPUT:
//   In promise 0
//   After promise 0
//   In promise 1
//   After promise 1
//   In promise 2
//   After promise 2
```

## Resolving and rejecting

Now that we know how to use a promise to execute asynchronously, we need to be able to set the state to `fulfilled` when things complete correctly, or to `rejected` when an error happens. The promise executor function takes two functions as parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve` sets the promise to the `fulfilled` state, and calling `reject` sets the promise to the `rejected` state.

Consider the following "coin toss" promise that waits ten seconds and then has a fifty percent chance of resolving or rejecting.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      resolve('success');
    } else {
      reject('error');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

If you log the coinToss promise object to the console immediately after calling the constructor, it will display that it is in the `pending` state.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```

If you then wait ten seconds and the log the coinToss promise object again, the state will either show as `fulfilled` or `rejected` depending upon the way the coin landed.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>}
```

## Then, catch, finally

With the ability to asynchronously execute and set the resulting state, we now need a way to generically do something with the result of a promise after it resolves. This is done with functionality similar to exception handling. The promise object has three functions: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. The `then` function is called if the promise is fulfilled, `catch` is called if the promise is `rejected`, and `finally` is always called after all the processing is completed.

We can rework our coinToss example and make it so 10 percent of the time the coin falls off the table and resolves to the rejected state. Otherwise the promise resolves to fulfilled with a result of either `heads` or `tails`.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
    } else {
      reject('fell off table');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

We then chain the `then`, `catch` and `finally` functions to the coinToss object in order to handle each of the possible results.

```js
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));

// OUTPUT:
//    Coin toss result: tails
//    Toss completed
```


## Await
If `coinToss()` is a Promise, then using `await`:
```js
try {
  const result = await coinToss();
  console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
  console.log(`Toss completed`);
}
```

```js
async function cow() {
  return 'moo';
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>: 'moo'}
```

We then change the cow function to explicitly create a promise instead of the automatically generated promise that the await keyword generates.

```js
async function cow() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve('moo');
  });
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```
If `cow()` is an `async` function (meaning a function that returns a promise), then `await` can be used like this instead of a promise chain:
```js
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}

console.log(await cow());
// OUTPUT: moo
```

**NOTE**: `await` can only be used in an `async` function or the top level module.


## Async
Declares that a function returns a promise. It can immediately return if it does not explicitly created a new Promise, meaning it just returns something else.

## Combining await and async
```js
const httpPromise = fetch('https://simon.cs260.click/api/user/me');
const jsonPromise = httpPromise.then((r) => r.json());
jsonPromise.then((j) => console.log(j));
console.log('done');

// OUTPUT: done
// OUTPUT: {email: 'bud@mail.com', authenticated: true}
```

With async/await, you can clarify the code intent by hiding the promise syntax, and also make the execution block until the promise is resolved.

```js
const httpResponse = await fetch('https://simon.cs260.click/api/user/me');
const jsonResponse = await httpResponse.json();
console.log(jsonResponse);
console.log('done');

// OUTPUT: {email: 'bud@mail.com', authenticated: true}
// OUTPUT: done
```
